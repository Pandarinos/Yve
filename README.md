# About Yve
Yve is a Python based Telegram bot, currently in development. The goal is, that Yve will be capable of creating chat stats and moderating chats.
Currently Yve is able to create chat stats about the whole network of the bot. For e.g. if you host a bot based on Yve on your server and add Yve to 5 groups all groups will have linked stats visible with /networkstats.
